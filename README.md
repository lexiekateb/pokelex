# PokeLex

## PokeAPI
I utilized the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch specific ID's of pokemon depending on user input or just incrementing/decrementing the ID number by button press. I displayed the ID number, weight, type, and a quick blurb about each PokeMon. In true PokeMon fashion, the decor of the website looks just like an in-game PokeDex.

This PokeLex supports all PokeMon from ID 1 to 898 (fully updated as of 2022).

## Easter Egg
My officemates thought it would be really funny to have an *almost* Pokemon hidden in the PokeLex... see if you can find it!
